# Stir Craft ‚Äì Internal Development Guide

Welcome to the main app## Development Guidelines

- Add new models, views, and templates inside `stir_craft/`.
- Use Django's app structure for scalability.
- Static files (images, CSS, JS) go in `stir_craft/static/`.
- Write tests in `stir_craft/tests.py`.
- Run tests before pushing:
  ```bash
  python manage.py test
  ```

## Data Management

### Using the Cocktail Import Command
The `seed_from_thecocktaildb` management command provides flexible options for importing cocktail data:

```bash
# Import a small test batch for development
python manage.py seed_from_thecocktaildb --limit 10

# Import from specific letters (useful for testing)
python manage.py seed_from_thecocktaildb --letters abc --limit 20

# Import a larger dataset for staging
python manage.py seed_from_thecocktaildb --limit 100

# Clear existing data and start fresh
python manage.py seed_from_thecocktaildb --clear --limit 25
```

### What the Import Does
- Fetches cocktail data from TheCocktailDB API
- Creates `Cocktail`, `Ingredient`, `Vessel`, and `RecipeComponent` records
- Intelligently categorizes ingredients (spirits, liqueurs, mixers, etc.)
- Parses measurements from text to structured data
- Adds flavor tags for filtering and search
- Provides comprehensive progress reporting

### Command Options
- `--limit N`: Import maximum N cocktails
- `--letters abc`: Only search letters a, b, c (useful for testing)
- `--clear`: Clear existing cocktail data before importing
- Default behavior: Import ALL available cocktails (500+)

## üç∏ Cocktail Forms Development Guide

### Overview
The cocktail forms system provides a complete solution for creating and managing cocktail recipes with multiple ingredients, measurements, and preparation notes.

### Key Components

#### Forms (`forms/cocktail_forms.py`)
- **`CocktailForm`**: Main cocktail information (name, description, instructions, vessel, tags)
- **`RecipeComponentFormSet`**: Manages multiple ingredients using Django's inline formsets
- **`CocktailSearchForm`**: Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- **`QuickIngredientForm`**: For future modal ingredient creation

#### Views Added
- **`cocktail_create`**: Handle formset creation with proper validation
- **`cocktail_list`**: Browse cocktails with search/filter/pagination
- **`cocktail_detail`**: Display complete recipe with stats and actions

#### Templates Created
- **`cocktail_create.html`**: Dynamic form with ingredient management
- **`cocktail_list.html`**: Responsive cocktail browsing interface
- **`cocktail_detail.html`**: Complete recipe display with nutritional info

### Development Guidelines for Forms

#### Creating New Forms
```python
# Example: Creating a custom form
class MyCustomForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = MyModel
        fields = ['field1', 'field2']
        widgets = {
            'field1': forms.TextInput(attrs={'class': 'form-control'}),
        }
```

#### Working with Formsets
```python
# Using inline formsets for related models
MyFormSet = inlineformset_factory(
    parent_model=ParentModel,
    model=ChildModel,
    fields=['field1', 'field2'],
    extra=3,  # Number of empty forms
    min_num=1,  # Minimum required forms
    max_num=10,  # Maximum allowed forms
    can_delete=True
)
```

#### Template Integration
```django
<!-- Form rendering with Bootstrap styling -->
<div class="mb-3">
    <label for="{{ form.field.id_for_label }}" class="form-label">{{ form.field.label }}</label>
    {{ form.field }}
    {% if form.field.errors %}
        <div class="invalid-feedback d-block">{{ form.field.errors.0 }}</div>
    {% endif %}
</div>
```

### Testing Forms
```python
# Example form test
def test_cocktail_form_valid(self):
    form_data = {
        'name': 'Test Cocktail',
        'instructions': 'Mix well',
        'is_alcoholic': True
    }
    form = CocktailForm(data=form_data)
    self.assertTrue(form.is_valid())
```

### URL Patterns
Add these to your URL configuration:
```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('cocktails/', views.cocktail_list, name='cocktail_list'),
    path('cocktails/create/', views.cocktail_create, name='cocktail_create'),
    path('cocktails/<int:cocktail_id>/', views.cocktail_detail, name='cocktail_detail'),
]
```r Stir Craft! This document outlines the steps and best practices for developing our cocktail and mocktail app.

## Project Structure

- All main app code should be placed in the `stir_craft/` directory (this folder).
- Avoid placing new code in higher-level directories unless absolutely necessary.

## Workflow & Branching

- **Always commit changes to your personal branch** (the one with your name on it). Do **not** commit directly to `main`.
- Open a pull request when your feature or fix is ready for review and merging.

## Current Focus: Wireframes

- We are currently working on wireframes to visualize the project pages.
- Wireframes and design assets are in `static/images/wireframes/`.
- Once wireframes are complete, we will move on to building out the models.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository** and create/switch to your personal branch.
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pipenv install
   ```
3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```
4. **Ensure PostgreSQL is running** and database is configured (see main README.md).
5. **Navigate to the Django project**:
   ```bash
   cd stircraft
   ```
6. **Apply migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
7. **Seed the database with cocktail data**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py seed_from_thecocktaildb --limit 10
   ```
8. **Create a superuser** (optional):
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
9. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Development Guidelines

- Add new models, views, and templates inside `stir_craft/`.
- Use Django‚Äôs app structure for scalability.
- Static files (images, CSS, JS) go in `stir_craft/static/`.
- Write tests in `stir_craft/tests.py`.
- Run tests before pushing:
  ```bash
  python manage.py test
  ```

## Testing Framework

We have implemented a comprehensive testing scaffold to ensure the reliability of our models and features. Follow these steps to use the testing framework after creating a new feature:

1. **Write Tests for Your Feature:**
   - Add test methods to the appropriate test class in `stir_craft/tests.py`.
   - Use assertions to validate expected behavior (e.g., `assertEqual`, `assertTrue`).
   - If your feature involves multiple models, write integration tests to verify their interactions.

2. **Run Tests Locally:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py test stir_craft
   ```
   - Use `--verbosity=2` for detailed output.
   - Target specific test classes or methods if needed.

3. **Fix Any Failures:**
   - Debug and resolve issues until all tests pass.

4. **Push Your Changes:**
   - Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`.
   - Commit and push your changes to the Feature Branch, including the updated tests.
   - Include your tests in the pull request to Testing Branch.

By maintaining high test coverage, we can ensure the stability and scalability of the Stir Craft app.

## Code Review & Merging

- Open a pull request for review.
- Ensure all tests pass and code follows team conventions.
- Only merge after approval.

## Keeping Your Local Repo Up to Date

To make sure your local repository stays current with the latest changes from the remote (cloud) repository:

1. **Fetch and merge the latest changes from main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. **Switch back to your personal branch and rebase (or merge) main into it:**
   ```bash
   git checkout <your-branch-name>
   git rebase main
   # or, if you prefer merging:
   git merge main
   ```
3. **Resolve any conflicts, test your code, and continue working.**

Keeping your branch up to date helps avoid merge conflicts and ensures you‚Äôre working with the latest code.

## Branch Update Utility

To ensure your local repository stays up to date and avoid merge conflicts, use the `update_branches_team.sh` script before committing changes:

1. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   ./update_branches_team.sh
   ```
   - This script will fetch the latest changes from the remote repository and update all local branches.
   - Replace `/path/to/your/local/stir-craft` in the script with your local repository path if needed.

2. **Verify updates:**
   - Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`.
   - Resolve any conflicts if they arise.

3. **Switch back to your feature branch:**
   - The script ends with your repository on the `main` branch.
   - Use the following command to return to your feature branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout <your-branch-name>
     ```

By running this utility regularly, you can maintain consistency across team workflows and minimize conflicts during development.

## Additional Notes

- Refer to the main project README for deployment and environment details.
- Keep this document updated as the project evolves.
